For directly accessible sites, COW will use direct access.\r\n\r\n# Features #\r\n\r\n- **Automatically identify blocked websites**\r\n- **Record which sites are blocked, which can be directly accessed**\r\n- **Generate and serve PAC file**\r\n- **Convert socks proxy to HTTP proxy**\r\n\r\n# Installation #\r\n\r\nFor OS X and Linux, run the following command to install pre-compiled binary (curl is required, along with trust):\r\n\r\n    curl -s -L https://github.com/cyfdecyf/cow/raw/master/install-cow.sh | bash\r\n\r\nRe-run the above command to update COW.\r\n\r\nExperimental windows binary is also provided, look at the [downloads page](https://github.com/cyfdecyf/cow/downloads).\r\n\r\n## From source ##\r\n\r\nInstall [go](http://golang.org/doc/install), set `$GOPATH`. Then run\r\n\r\n    go get github.com/cyfdecyf/cow\r\n\r\nUse `go get -u github.com/cyfdecyf/cow` to update COW.\r\n\r\n# Usage #\r\n\r\nConfiguration file is located at `~/.cow/rc`. Here's a [sample config](https://github.com/cyfdecyf/cow/blob/master/doc/sample-config/rc) with comments for each option.\r\n\r\nTo start cow, just execute `cow` on the command line.\r\n\r\n- The PAC file can be accessed at `http://<proxy listen address>/pac`\r\n- Command line options can override options in the configuration file\r\n  - For more details, see the output of `cow -h`\r\n\r\n# Limitations #\r\n\r\n- Designed to run on your own computer\r\n  - COW can serve multiple users, but no authentication is provided now\r\n- No caching, COW just passes traffic between clients and web servers\r\n  - For web browsing, browsers have their own cache\r\n- Blocked site detection is not always reliable\r\n- Beta quality now\r\n  - Stable enough for myself. I'm using COW as system wide proxy on OS X 10.8 everyday\r\n  - **Issue reporting is welcomed**\r\n\r\n# Misc #\r\n\r\nFor more information, take a look at [README](https://github.com/cyfdecyf/cow#readme).\r\n\r\nContact: Twitter [@cyfdecyf](https://twitter.com/cyfdecyf)","google":""}
